# Faction Query Tool

This script is written in Python, so you will need to have it installed to run it. As with most tools in this repo, you will need a copy of the Quarm EQ database running where you can access it.

Usage: 
Set up your database.
Enter the database connection information in eqdb.ini
On a command line, run: fq.py
You will be prompted for user/pass to your database if you do not set those in
the eqdb.ini file.
You will then be asked what faction you wish to query. Asterisks are accepted.
Example:
  \*freeport\* - Returns 'Citizens of Freeport' and 'The Freeport Militia'.

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to post them here and I will look into it.
